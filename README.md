# Arabic Handwritten Character Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project Overview
TThe project is a web-based application called AraboScripto designed to recognize handwritten Arabic characters. It Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process the character in the image uploaded and output the corresponding name of that character.

## Key Features
- **Upload Handwriting:** Users can upload images of handwritten Arabic characters in PNG format.
- **Character Recognition:** Using CNN model, the application accurately identifies handwritten characters and outputs their corresponding name.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** Java (with React.js), HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Flask (python)
- **Machine Learning:** Keras, TensorFlow, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

## Current Progress
- Developed the CNN model with four convolutional layers, four max pooling layers, and three dense layers, achieving an accuracy of 82.5%.
- Developed the frontend and backend infrastructure to handle image uploads and character recognition requests.

## Future Enhancements
- Expand the dataset to include more diverse handwriting samples for improved accuracy.
- Data Augmentation to avoid overfitting.
